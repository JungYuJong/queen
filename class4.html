<p>In 1975 Bohemian Rapsody, was very famouse music at that time.But the music's play time was 6 min. But this music is fusion music opera, rock, acapella.</p>

 Is this the real life? 
 Is this just fantasy? 
Caught in a landslide, 
 No escape from reality. 
 
 
 Open your eyes, 
 Look up to the skies and see, 
 I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, 
 Because I'm easy come, easy go, 
 Little high, little low, 
 Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me. 

 
 Mama, just killed a man, 
 Put a gun against his head, 
 Pulled my trigger, now he's dead. 
 Mama, life had just begun, 
 But now I've gone and thrown it all away. 
 
 
 Mama, ooh, 
 Didn't mean to make you cry, 
 If I'm not back again this time tomorrow, 
 Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters. 
 
 
 Too late, my time has come, 
 Sends shivers down my spine, 
 Body's aching all the time. 
 Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go, 
 Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth. 
 
 
 Mama, ooh (any way the wind blows), 
 I don't wanna die, 
 I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all. 
 
 
 I see a little silhouetto of a man, 
 Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango? 
 Thunderbolt and lightning, 
 Very, very frightening me. 
 (Galileo) Galileo. 
 (Galileo) Galileo, 
 Galileo Figaro 
 Magnifico-o-o-o-o. 
 
 
 I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me. 
 He's just a poor boy from a poor family, 
 Spare him his life from this monstrosity. 
 
 
 Easy come, easy go, will you let me go? 
 Bismillah! No, we will not let you go. (Let him go!) 
 Bismillah! We will not let you go. (Let him go!) 
 Bismillah! We will not let you go. (Let me go!) 
 Will not let you go. (Let me go!) 
 Never let you go (Never, never, never, never let me go) 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no 
 Oh, mama mia, mama mia (Mama mia, let me go.) 
 Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me. 
 
 
 So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye? 
 So you think you can love me and leave me to die? 
 Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby, 
 Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here. 
 
 
 Nothing really matters, 
 Anyone can see, 
 Nothing really matters, 
 Nothing really matters to me. 
 Any way the wind blows.</i> </div>

 She keeps her Moet et Chandon 
 In her pretty cabinet 
 "Let them eat cake", she says 
 Just like Marie Antoinette 
 A built-in remedy 
 For Kruschev and Kennedy 
 At anytime an invitation 
 You can't decline 
 
 
 Caviar and cigarettes 
 Well versed in etiquette 
 Extraordinarily nice. 

 
 She's a Killer Queen 
 Gunpowder, gelatin 
 Dynamite with a laser beam 
 Guaranteed to blow your mind 
 Anytime 
 
 
 Recommended at the price 
 Insatiable an appetite 
 Wanna try? 
 
 
 To avoid complications 
 She never kept the same address 
 In conversation 
 She spoke just like a baroness 
 Met a man from China 
 Went down to Geisha Minah 
 Then again incidentally 
 If you're that way inclined 
 
 
 Perfume came naturally from Paris (naturally) 
 For cars she couldn't care less 
 Fastidious and precise 
 
 
 She's a Killer Queen 
 Gunpowder, gelatin 
 Dynamite with a laser beam 
 Guaranteed to blow your mind 
 Anytime 
 
 
 Drop of a hat she's as willing as 
 Playful as a pussy cat 
 Temporarily out of gas 
 To absolutely drive you wild, wild 
 She's all out to get you 
 
 
 She's a Killer Queen 
 Gunpowder, gelatin 
 Dynamite with a laser beam 
 Guaranteed to blow your mind 
 Anytime 
 
 
 Recommended at the price 
 Insatiable an appetite 
 Wanna try? 
 You wanna try.
